# What is this?

This is a simple implementation for "Dropbox.Api" commonly used methods. It uses Dropbox.Api version 4.7.0.
It contains an implementation project and a test project which can be used to perform all the operations within the implementation.

# Why was it created?
It was created as part of a bigger project to make sure that when upgrading to higher "Dropbox.Api" version, the problems
could be easily detected and fixed.

# How to use it?
1. Create a Dropbox account
2. Copy and paste your access token from Dropbox into the "DropboxManager" -> "ACCESS_TOKEN" field.
3. Set your application root url in "DropboxManager" -> "APP_ROOT_URI" field.
